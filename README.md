This project was created for my Computer Science 30 (Grade 12) final project, with the help of my project partner!

The application is based upon the PowerSchool app used at thousands of high schools across North America. 

Our idea was to create all of the features that PowerSchool provides its users in a terminal-based application in two weeks.

Features of the application include the following:
- Login system for students and teachers
- Grade viewer
- Grade manager
- Class scheduling system
- Goal setting
- Dropping and adding classes
- Weightage system for grades


Possible Improvements:
- Real user interface for a better experience
- More features such as an attendance system
